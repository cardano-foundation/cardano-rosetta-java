Rosetta-Java Cardano Application ‚Äî Development Guide (Context Window For AI Agents)

‚úÖ Overview

This project is a Java implementation of the Rosetta specification, adapted from Coinbase‚Äôs original mesh. It targets the Cardano blockchain and is optimized for performance, scalability, and testability.

‚∏ª

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Standards
‚Ä¢	Java 24 ‚Äì Latest LTS features leveraged.
‚Ä¢	Lombok ‚Äì For reducing boilerplate (e.g., getters, constructors).
‚Ä¢	Hibernate + JOOQ ‚Äì A hybrid approach planned:
‚Ä¢	Hibernate for standard ORM tasks.
‚Ä¢	JOOQ for complex SQL operations.
‚Ä¢	Hibernate for standard ORM needs.
‚Ä¢	JOOQ for high-performance, complex SQL queries.
‚Ä¢	Flywheel ‚Äì Used for event-sourced state and domain logic.
‚Ä¢	OpenAPI (api.yaml) ‚Äì Contract-first approach:
‚Ä¢	Edit src/main/resources/rosetta-specifications-1.4.15/api.yaml for API changes.
‚Ä¢	Code generation tools automatically create request/response classes.
‚Ä¢	No Spring RestControllers ‚Äì All endpoints are generated from OpenAPI spec; avoid manually annotating endpoints.
‚Ä¢	JUnit 5 with @Nested tests ‚Äì Organize tests into logical groups.
‚Ä¢	AssertJ ‚Äì Preferred assertion framework for fluent and expressive assertions.

üìã Step-by-Step Context Window / Discovery

1. Rosetta API Specification
   ‚Ä¢	Maintained in:
   src/main/resources/rosetta-specifications-1.4.15/api.yaml
   ‚Ä¢	‚ùó All endpoints and models are generated, do not manually modify controller classes.

2. Code Generation
   ‚Ä¢	Triggered via build tools (Gradle/Maven).
   ‚Ä¢	Output includes:
   ‚Ä¢	DTOs
   ‚Ä¢	Server interfaces
   ‚Ä¢	Clients
   ‚Ä¢	Ensures OpenAPI remains the single source of truth.

3. Persistence Layer
   ‚Ä¢	Hibernate handles standard CRUD and entity management.
   ‚Ä¢	JOOQ will be used for:
   ‚Ä¢	Bulk operations
   ‚Ä¢	Deep filtering
   ‚Ä¢	Custom joins / window functions
   ‚Ä¢	Both work seamlessly alongside Flywheel event sourcing.

4. Domain Logic with Flywheel
   ‚Ä¢	Domain state transitions are event-driven.
   ‚Ä¢	Promotes traceability and immutability.

5. Testing Strategy
   ‚Ä¢	JUnit 5 with @Nested classes to:
   ‚Ä¢	Separate concerns within test files.
   ‚Ä¢	Improve readability and scope clarity.
   ‚Ä¢	AssertJ provides fluent API for:
   ‚Ä¢	Clean, expressive assertions.
   ‚Ä¢	Better failure messages than vanilla JUnit or Hamcrest.

üìé Notes
‚Ä¢	Avoid using @RestController or manual API layer.
‚Ä¢	All changes to API contract must be made in api.yaml.
‚Ä¢	Lombok annotations (@Value, @Builder, @Getter, etc.) are preferred to minimize boilerplate.
