################ Local Node Configuration for Node-to-Client (Optional) ######
# Most of the information in the indexer are fetched through remote
# host and port configured in the previous section, but few information
# like protocol parameters are fetched through "Node Socket" file of
# local Cardano node using node-to-client protocol. The transaction submission
# endpoint also uses this interface.
# If a local node configuration is not found, the yaci-store just ignores those data.
# Alternatively, Local node socket for node-to-client protocol can be exposed to remote client
# using relay like "socat". In that case, set cardano.n2c.host and cardano.n2c.port
