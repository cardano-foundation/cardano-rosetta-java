# Patterns to ignore when building packages.
# This supports shell glob matching, relative path matching, and
# negation (prefixed with !). Only one pattern per line.

# Common VCS dirs
.git/
.gitignore
.gitmodules

# Common backup files
*.swp
*.bak
*.tmp
*~

# OS files
.DS_Store

# Large optional node files that are not required for deployment.
# The configmap-node-config.yaml template already guards these with
# {{- if .Files.Get ... }} so their absence is handled gracefully.
# Mainnet peer-snapshot and checkpoints are optimisation hints only;
# the node falls back to topology-based discovery when absent.
