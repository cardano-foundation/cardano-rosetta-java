# Environment variables

Environment variables configure the behavior of the application. This page documents all available environment variables, their default values, and version history.

## Configuration Files

The root folder contains several example `.env` files for different deployment scenarios:

**Standard Deployments:**
- `.env.docker-compose` - Standard docker compose setup for mainnet (copy and adjust for your needs)
- `.env.docker-compose-preprod` - Pre-configured for preprod network
- `.env.h2` - Local development with H2 in-memory database
- `.env.h2-testdata` - H2 database with test data

**Hardware Performance Profiles:**
- `.env.docker-compose-profile-entry-level` - Minimal hardware requirements
- `.env.docker-compose-profile-mid-level` - Moderate hardware (recommended baseline)
- `.env.docker-compose-profile-advanced-level` - High-performance hardware

**Testing:**
- `.env.IntegrationTest` - Integration tests with yaci devkit

> **Note**: Hardware profile files should be used **in combination** with a base `.env.docker-compose` file to apply performance tuning settings. See the Hardware Profile Variables section below.
