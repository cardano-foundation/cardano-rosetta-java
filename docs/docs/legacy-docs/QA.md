# QA

[![CI][img_src_CI]][workflow_CI]

Integration of new code to the master is permitted if the `cardano-rosetta-server` test suite
passes, and the Dockerfile builds and passes a simple smoke test.

[![Nightly][img_src_Nightly]][workflow_Nightly]

The [rosetta-cli] validates the correctness of
a fully synced Cardano Rosetta mainnet instance, using configuration maintained in source control.
A snapshot of the state is stored in an S3 bucket, and is maintained by this workflow.

[![Pre-release][img_src_Pre-release]][workflow_Pre-release]

The defined workflow perform a Docker build without using the available cache, and then follows
up with test network builds. This is supplemented with other manual more comprehensive [check]s,
including the `check:construction` due to limitations with the tooling. The intention is to
automate [when possible].
